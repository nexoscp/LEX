# Description

Simple Lexer/Scanner-Generator written in Scala (for now). Generates non blocking Lexer

# Motivation

There are many Lexer-Generator out there. Many way better than this one. But no one generates non blocking lexer.  

# Feature
    Speed!
	Async (push vs pull)
	Generate Behavoir/Session Types
	Binary and text-protocols (http 1 with upgrade to http 2)
	support multible char sets with change of charset on the fly
	safe! memory, control flow
	Type mapping from generator language to runtime language
